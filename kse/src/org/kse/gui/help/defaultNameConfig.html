        <hr>

        This allows to store default values for certificate distinguished names (DNs). 
        When you create a new certificate, the input fields for Common Name, Organizational Unit, 
        Organization etc. are pre-filled with the values from this configuration setting.

        <p>

        To configure the Default Name:

        <ol>
            <li>From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Preferences</b>.
            <br><br>
            <b>Mac OS users:</b> From the <b>KeyStore Explorer</b> menu, choose <b>Preferences</b>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Preferences</b> dialog will be displayed.  Select the <b>Default Name</b> tab.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Enter any part of the DN that you normally use in your certificate DNs.  </li>
