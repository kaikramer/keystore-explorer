        <h1>About Keys</h1>
        <hr>

        A Key contains a single symmetric cryptographic key.
        Key entries are represented in KeyStore Explorer by the following icon:

        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/key_entry.png">
        </p>
        <p>
        Key entries are protected by a password.  In KeyStore Explorer such entries
        are described as being <b>Locked</b> and have a closed padlock displayed
        against them:
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/locked_entry.png">
        </p>
        <p>
        To access the key the entry must be <a href="unlockKey.html"><b>Unlocked</b></a>
        by supplying the correct password.  If an entry is successfully unlocked then an open
        padlock is displayed against it:
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/unlocked_entry.png">
        </p>
        <p>
        If a Key Pair entry is unlocked once during a KeyStore Explorer
        session it does not need to be unlocked again.  A Key Pair entry may be
        unlocked explicitly or as part of an operation that requires the private key.
        </p>
        <p>
        As key entries do not contain any certificates no value is shown for them in the
        <b>Certificate Expiry</b> column of the KeyStore table.
        </p>
