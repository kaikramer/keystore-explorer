        <h1>About Certificate Extensions</h1>
        <hr>

        Certificate extensions can be <a href="addCertificateExtensions.html">added</a>
        to Version 3 X.509 certificates during
        <a href="generateKeyPair.html">Key Pair generation</a> or when
        <a href="signCsr.html">signing a CSR</a>.  Extensions allow extra attributes to
        be attached to the certificate.

        <p>

        KeyStore Explorer supports the addition of most of the set of extensions
        specified in RFC 5280 (Certificate Profile) and the Netscape Certificate
        Extensions.  See <a href="specifications.html">Specifications</a> for details
        of supported certificate extensions.

        <p>

        The RFC 5280 extensions tend to be complex structures.  See the
        <b>Certificate Extensions</b> section of the RFC document
        <b>Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile</b> for
        specific details. This document is freely available on the internet.
        The Netscape set of extensions are simpler and their specifics are
        documented generally on the web.
