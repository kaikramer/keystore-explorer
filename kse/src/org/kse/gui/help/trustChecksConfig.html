        <h1>Trust Checks Configuration</h1>
        <hr>

        Chain of Trust Checks can be enabled or disabled. This is relevant when importing Trusted Certificates
        and CA replies. Disabling trust checks simplifies these import processes at the cost of security. In addition,
        enabling trust checks for CA Reply imports has the advantage of automatically completing key pair chains
        to any trusted root (if present).

        <p>

        To configure the Trust Checks:

        <ol>
            <li>From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Preferences</b>.
            <br><br>
            <b>Mac OS users:</b> From the <b>KeyStore Explorer</b> menu, choose <b>Preferences</b>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Preferences</b> dialog will be displayed.  Select the <b>Trust Checks</b>
                tab.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Tick or untick the <b>Import Trusted Certificate</b> and <b>Import CA Reply</b>
                check boxes to enable and disable the trust checks as required.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Press the <b>OK</b> button to save your settings and dismiss the <b>Preferences</b>
                dialog.</li>

        </ol>
