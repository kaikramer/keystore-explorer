        <h1>Examine an SSL Connection</h1>
        <hr>

        To examine an SSL connection's certificates:

        <ol>
            <li>From the <b>Examine</b> menu, choose <b>Examine SSL</b>.
                Alternatively click on the <b>Examine SSL</b> tool bar
                button:
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/examinessl.png"></li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Examine SSL</b> dialog will appear.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Enter the <b>SSL Host</b> and <b>Port</b> of the connection
                to be examined.  Your last ten input values are saved and available 
                via the drop down box. </li>

            <br>

            <li>Optionally you can activate <b>client authentication</b>.  
            	You have just to select a KeyStore and the private key 
            	from KeyStore is used to authenticate against the SSL server. 
            	If there is more than one private key in the KeyStore that could 
            	be used for client authentication, then standard Java mechanisms 
            	are used to find the right one.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Click on the <b>OK</b> button.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Certificate Details for SSL Connection</b> dialog will appear.</li>

            <br>

            <li>After viewing the details close the dialog by clicking on the
                <b>OK</b> button.</li>
        </ol>
