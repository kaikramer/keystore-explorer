        <h1>Export a Key Pair's Private Key as OpenSSL</h1>
        <hr>

        To export a Key Pair's private key as OpenSSL:

        <ol>
            <li>Right-click on the Key Pair entry in the KeyStore Entries
                table.  Select the <b>Export</b> sub-menu from the
                pop-up menu and from there choose <b>Export Private Key</b>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>If required the <b>Unlock Entry</b> dialog will be displayed.
                Enter the Key Pair entry's password and press the <b>OK</b> button.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Export Private Key Type</b> dialog will appear.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Select the <b>OpenSSL</b> radio button and press the <b>OK</b> button.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Export Private Key as OpenSSL</b> dialog is displayed.</li>

            <br>

            <li>If the exported OpenSSL private key file is to be unencrypted then uncheck the
                <b>Encrypt</b> check box.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Alternatively if the OpenSSL private key file is to be encrypted select an
                <b>Encryption Algorithm</b> and enter and confirm an <b>Encryption Password</b>.
                The supported PBE encryption algorithms for export are:</li>

            <ul>
                <li>PBE with DES CBC</li>
                <li>PBE with DESede CBC</li>
                <li>PBE with 128 bit AES CBC</li>
                <li>PBE with 192 bit AES CBC</li>
                <li>PBE with 256 bit AES CBC</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Check the <b>PEM</b> checkbox if the exported private key is to be PEM encoded.
                When a private key is to be encrypted it must also be PEM encoded.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Use the <b>Browse</b> button to select an export file.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Press the <b>Export</b> button to commence the export.</li>
        </ol>
