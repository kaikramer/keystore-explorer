        <h1>Authority Certificates Configuration</h1>
        <hr>

        Additional certificates can be considered when forming trust paths and
        attempting to match root certificates.  This is relevant when importing Trusted Certificates
        and CA replies.

        <p>

        Such Authority Certificates can be sourced from a designated CA Certificates KeyStore and,
        for Windows users, the Windows Trusted Root Certificates.

        <p>

        To configure the Authority Certificates:

        <ol>
            <li>From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Preferences</b>.
            <br><br>
            <b>Mac OS users:</b> From the <b>KeyStore Explorer</b> menu, choose <b>Preferences</b>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Preferences</b> dialog will be displayed.  Select the <b>Authority Certificates</b>
                tab.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The default <b>CA Certificates KeyStore</b> is the <b>cacerts</b> file bundled with Java.
                To change to another KeyStore:</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Press the <b>Browse</b> button.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li>The <b>Choose CA Certificates KeyStore</b> dialog will appear.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li>Select the drive and folder where the KeyStore file is located.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li>Type the filename into the <b>File Name</b> text box.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li>Click on the <b>Choose</b> button.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Tick the <b>Use CA Certificates KeyStore</b> check box to enable its use.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Tick the <b>Use Windows Trusted Root Certificates</b> check box to enable its use.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Press the <b>OK</b> button to save your settings and dismiss the <b>Preferences</b>
                dialog.</li>

        </ol>

        <b>Notes:</b>

        <ul>
            <li>If the use of the CA Certificates KeyStore is enabled then the first time that
                you attempt to import a Trusted Certificate or CA Reply in a KeyStore Explorer
                session you will be prompted for the CA Certificates KeyStore password.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The default password for the <b>cacerts</b> file bundled with Java is "changeit".</li>
        </ul>
