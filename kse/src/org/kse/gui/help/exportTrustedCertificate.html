        <hr>

        To export a Trusted Certificate:

        <ol>
            <li>Right-click on the Trusted Certificate entry in the KeyStore Entries
                table.  Select the <b>Export</b> sub-menu from the pop-up menu and
                from there choose <b>Export Certificate</b>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Export Certificate</b> dialog is displayed.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Select an <b>Export Format</b>.  The options available are:</li>

            <ul>
                <li><b>X.509</b> ITU-T standard for public key infrastructure.</li>
                <li><b>PKCS #7</b> RSA public key cryptography standard.</li>
                <li><b>PKI Path</b> Certification path.</li>
                <li><b>SPC</b> Software Publisher Certificate, Microsoft's certificate format.</li>
            </ul>
