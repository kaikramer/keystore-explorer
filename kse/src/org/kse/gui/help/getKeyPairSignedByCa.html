        <h1>Get a Key Pair Signed by a CA (Certificate Authority)</h1>
        <hr>

        To get a Key Pair signed by a CA:

        <ol>

            <li>First <a href="createNewKeyStore.html">create a new KeyStore</a>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Either <a href="importKeyPairPkcs12.html">import an existing Key Pair</a>
                into the KeyStore or <a href="generateKeyPair.html">generate a new Key Pair</a>
                in the KeyStore.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Next <a href="generateCsr.html">generate a CSR</a> (Certificate Signing Request)
                file from the Key Pair.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Send the CSR file to a CA for signing.  Each CA has different
                procedures for signing certificates and will charge a fee.  Check the CA's web site
                for details.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The CA will send back a CA Reply.  This will most likely take the form of
                a file with the extension p7r or cer.</li>

            <br>

            <li><a href="importCaReply.html">Import the CA Reply</a> into the original Key Pair.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The Key Pair has now been signed by the CA.
                <a href="viewKeyPairCertificateChain.html">View the Key Pair's certificate chain</a>.
                Your certificate, at the end of the chain, will contain the CA's details in the
                issuer field.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Finally <a href="saveKeyStore.html">save the KeyStore</a>.</li>

        </ol>
