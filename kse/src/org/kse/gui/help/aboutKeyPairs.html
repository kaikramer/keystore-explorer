        <h1>About Key Pairs</h1>
        <hr/>

        A Key Pair contains a private key and its associated certificate
        chain.  Key Pairs can be used to digitally sign objects such as Java
        applications.  Key Pair entries are represented in KeyStore Explorer
        by the following icon:

        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/keypair_entry.png">
        </p>
        <p>
        As the private key part of the Key Pair should remain secret, Key Pair entries
        are normally protected by a password.  In KeyStore Explorer such entries
        are described as being <b>Locked</b> and have a closed padlock displayed
        against them:
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/locked_entry.png">
        </p>
        <p>
        To access the private key the entry must be <a href="unlockKeyPair.html"><b>Unlocked</b></a>
        by supplying the correct password.  If an entry is successfully unlocked then an open
        padlock is displayed against it:
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/unlocked_entry.png">
        </p>
        <p>
        If a Key Pair entry is unlocked once during a KeyStore Explorer
        session it does not need to be unlocked again.  A Key Pair entry may be
        unlocked explicitly or as part of an
        operation that requires the private key.
        </p>
        <p>
        A Key Pair must be unlocked to utilize it for operations such as digital
        signing or to view or export the private key.
        </p>
