        <h1>Drag Export a Key Pair</h1>
        <hr>

        To drag export a Key Pair:

        <ol>
            <li>Ensure the Key Pair entry is <a href="unlockKeyPair.html">Unlocked</a>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Select the Key Pair entry for dragging by pressing
                and holding the left mouse button over it in the KeyStore entries
                table.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Use the mouse to drag the entry to the desired export location.  For example:
                the desktop, a folder or a text editor.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Release the left mouse button over the export location.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The entry will be exported.  The export format used depends on the
                export location:</li>

            <ul>

                <li>When exporting as a file the export format is <b>PKCS #12</b>.
                    This is applicable when the entry is dragged to the desktop or
                    to a folder.</li>

                <br>

                <li>When exporting as text the export is in two parts.  The private key is
                    exported as Encrypted <b>PKCS #8 PEM</b> and the certificate chain is
                    exported as <b>PKCS #7 PEM</b>.  This is applicable when the entry is
                    dragged to an application that deals with text.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Exports that are password protected inherit the password of the originating
                Key Pair entry. </li>

        </ol>
