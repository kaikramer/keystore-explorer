        To close a KeyStore:

        <ol>
            <li>Select the required KeyStore by clicking on its tab.</li>

            <br>

            <li>From the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Close</b>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>If the KeyStore does not have unsaved changes then it will
                be closed immediately.</li>

            <br>

            <li>If the KeyStore contains unsaved changes:</li>

            <ol style="margin-bottom: 0px">

                <li>A dialog will appear asking if you want to save it.</li>

                <br>

                <li>Answering <b>No</b> closes the KeyStore losing the unsaved changes.</li>
