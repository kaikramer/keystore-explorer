        <h1>Password Quality Configuration</h1>
        <hr>

        KeyStores, Key Pairs and exported key files are protected by passwords.  The passwords
        used to protect these items should be difficult to guess.  KeyStore Explorer provides
        an optional password quality meter which can be used to display the quality rating of all
        new passwords and, if necessary, enforce a minimum requirement on password quality.

        <p>

        To configure Password Quality:

        <ol>
            <li>From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Preferences</b>.
            <br><br>
            <b>Mac OS users:</b> From the <b>KeyStore Explorer</b> menu, choose <b>Preferences</b>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Preferences</b> dialog will be displayed.  Select the <b>Password Quality</b>
                tab.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Tick the <b>Enable Password Quality</b> check box to activate the password quality
                meter.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Tick the <b>Enforce Minimum Password Quality</b> check box to disallow any new
                passwords weaker than the minimum defined in the next step.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Adjust the <b>Minimum Password Quality</b> slider to select the desired password
                quality minimum from the range 0-100.  The higher the selected minimum the more
                secure new passwords are required to be.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Press the <b>OK</b> button to save your settings and dismiss the <b>Preferences</b>
                dialog.</li>

        </ol>
