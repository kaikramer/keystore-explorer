        <h2>What is KeyStore Explorer?</h2>

        <b>KeyStore Explorer</b> is a <b>free</b> GUI replacement for the Java command-line utilities <b>keytool</b>,
        <b>jarsigner</b> and <b>jadtool</b>.  KeyStore Explorer presents their functionality,
        and more, via an intuitive graphical user interface:

        <h2>Simplified Development of Secure Java</h2>

        A software developer should be able to focus on the problem at hand without struggling with obtuse
        command-line tools.  With KeyStore Explorer tricky, mundane security tasks such as key pair
        generation and code signing become quick and simple.

        <h2>Manage KeyStores</h2>

        KeyStore Explorer can be used to create and navigate KeyStores via its intuitive graphical
        interface.  The contents of KeyStores can be created and modified, imported and exported using
        just a few simple dialogs.

        <h2>Sign Java Code</h2>

        KeyStore Explorer provides the capability to digitally sign Java applications in both JAR and
        J2ME "MIDlet" form.

        <h2>Extensive Format Support</h2>

        KeyStore Explorer supports a variety of KeyStore, key pair, private key and certificate formats.

        <h2>Run Almost Anywhere</h2>

        KeyStore Explorer is 100% pure Java and will run on any machine that has an
        Oracle JRE installed.  Its capabilities are therefore available on Windows, Mac, Unix and Linux.
