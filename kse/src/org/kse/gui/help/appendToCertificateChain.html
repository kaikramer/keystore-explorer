        <h1>Append to Certificate Chain</h1>
        <hr>

        To append a certificate to the end of a Key Pair's Certificate Chain:

        <ol> 
            <li>Right-click on the Key Pair entry in the KeyStore Entries
                table.  Select the <b>Edit Certificate Chain</b> sub-menu from the
                pop-up menu and from there choose <b>Append Certificate</b>.</li>                

            <br>

            <li>If required the <b>Unlock Entry</b> dialog will be displayed.
                Enter the Key Pair entry's password and press the <b>OK</b> button.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Append Certificate</b> dialog will appear.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Select the drive and folder where the certificate file to be appended is stored.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Click on the required certificate file or type the filename
                into the <b>File Name</b> text box.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Click on the <b>Append</b> button.</li>

            <br>

            <li>For the append to succeed, the chosen certificate's private key must
                have been used to sign the end certificate of the chain.  An indication
                that this is the case is if the chosen certificate's subject is identical
                to the end certificate's issuer.</li>

            <br>

            <li>If the append is successful the Key Pair entry's certificate chain will be updated to include
                the appended certificate.</li>

        </ol>
