        <b>Notes:</b>

        <ul>
            <li>KeyStore Explorer has an internal clipboard for cut, copy and paste
                operations called the <b>buffer</b>.
                Therefore KeyStore entries cannot be cut or copied from KeyStore Explorer
                to other applications and vice versa.</li>
