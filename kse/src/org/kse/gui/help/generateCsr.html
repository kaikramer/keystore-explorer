        <h1>Generate a CSR</h1>
        <hr>

        To generate a CSR for a Key Pair:

        <ol>
            <li>Right-click on the Key Pair entry in the KeyStore
                Entries table.  Select <b>Generate CSR</b> from
                the pop-up menu.</li>

            <br>

            <li>If required the <b>Unlock Entry</b> dialog will be displayed.
                Enter the Key Pair entry's password and press the <b>OK</b> button.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The <b>Generate CSR</b> dialog is displayed.  Select a
                <b>Format</b> and <b>Signature Algorithm</b> and enter a
                <b>Challenge</b>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>For PKCS#10 format you can optionally enter a <b>company name</b>
            (which becomes an "unstructuredName" attribute in the request)
            and/or add the <b>extensions</b> from the certificate to the request.
            The latter is useful for SSL certificates with SubjectAlternativeName extensions.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Use the <b>Browse</b> button to select a <b>CSR File</b>.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Press the <b>OK</b> button to commence generation and produce the CSR.</li>
