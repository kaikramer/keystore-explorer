        <h1>About Trusted Certificates</h1>
        <hr>

        A Trusted Certificate contains a single certificate.
        Trusted Certificate entries are represented in KeyStore Explorer
        by the following icon:

        <p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/trustcert_entry.png">

        <p>

        Trusted Certificates are used to form chains of trust during operations
        such as <a href="importCaReply.html">importing a CA Reply</a>.
